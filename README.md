# APP-HTS-Trip-Purpose-Shiny

The Household Travel Survey (HTS) Trip Purpose App is an R-Shiny app that displays the number of trips generated by purpose for different sample segments, travel modes, household number of vehicles, and household number of workers.

The `dataprep` folder contains a jupyter notebook with the code to access the 2023 HTS via BigQuery API and the SQL code to generate the `trips_by_type.csv`.

Some data issues still remain to be resolved, such as the higher number of 'missing response' trips.

The app can be access here: https://wfrc.shinyapps.io/2023-utah-household-travel-survey-trips-generated/
